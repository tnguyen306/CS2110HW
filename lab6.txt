Put your answers in this file and submit it under the T-Square assignment.


Problem 1
---------
A) The BILL 9000 computer has 16 address wires and has a 8 bit word size.

The addressability of this memory is...
how much can be stored in each memory location, 8 buts



The address space of this memory is...
each wire has two so 2^16



B) The NOOB 2110 computer (also sold as the ANDREW 2110 computer in some markets)
has 7 address wires and has a 8 bit word size.However memory addresses 0x00 - 0x1F
are not able to be written to or read from.

The addressability of this memory is...
8 bits



The address space of this memory is...
2^7 -32



(Some things to think about)
- What is the addressability of your laptop computer?

- What is the address space of your laptop computer?


Problem 2
---------

What is the difference between combinational and sequential logic?
combination is “time independent” where the output is a function of the inputs
sequential depends on the past state of the system as well as the present set of inputs



Complete the following table by marking an "x" where applicable.

|========================================|
| Component | Combinational | Sequential |
|========================================|
| ALU       |       x       |            |
| AND GATE  |       x       |            |
| REGISTER  |               |     X      |
| MEMORY    |               |     x      |
| DECODER   |       x       |            |
| RS LATCH  |               |     x      |
=========================================|


Problem 3
---------
Make a 2-bit addressable memory that has a address space of 8. (i.e. there are 8 addresses each holding 2 bits)
You do not need to turn this circuit in, but it is highly recommend that you actually make it.


How many bits are there for the output of your memory?
2


How many bits are there for the address input of the memory?
3



Make sure to ask the TA's if you have any questions!
