1) What is the purpose of a splitter? Can It be used to join wires?
The purpose of the splitter is to split multi-bit values into different bits so that the user
can route those splitted bits into different directions. Example in the part2 of the homework,
the splitter happens to actually split an incoming value of 3 into three outgoing values. 

The splitter can be used to join wires together because the splitter is non-directional.
It can spli multiple into singles and combine singles into multiple.

2) why are tunnels useful?
A tunnel is like a wire that is bind points together with out the wire being explicitly drawn,
this make tunels when the user wants to connect points far apart and a network of wires would
make the circuit more disorganized.In addition, tunnels can be used to connect multiple points
togehter as long as the tunnels has the same label. If the label has a different label, it is 
considered to belong to a different circuit.

3) What are the output of your circuit when you give it an input of 010?
The output would be 0, because the circuit requires both to be one (110) to be on

Input of 100?
The output would also be 1 because this input is linked to the OR function so as long as
one input is green ( or 1) the output would turn on (or become green).
