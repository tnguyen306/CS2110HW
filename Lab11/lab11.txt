CS2110                                Lab #11                           Spring 2015
===================================================================================

This is not a timed lab, so feel free to collaborate with your neighbors, use
the book, and ask the TAs for explanation if you need help. When you are done,
please submit your assignment to T-Square to get credit! for participating.


1) Simple assembly program

Create two symbols/locations/labels A and B
Note: These labels must be named "A" and "B"
Initialize location A to 157 and B to 257
Write code that does the following (note that your code must perform these computations)

    Load A into R0
    Load B into R1
    Put A+B at Address x5001
    Put A&B at Address x5002
    Put -A at address x5003
    Put 2 * A + 3 * B at address x5004

Write your code in a file named simple.asm and submit it at the end of lab.


2) Sumtorial

Sumtorial is similar to factorial, except you are adding instead of multiplying.

SUMTORIAL(0) is 0
SUMTORIAL(1) is 0 + 1 is 1
SUMTORIAL(2) is 0 + 1 + 2 is 3
SUMTORIAL(3) is 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 is 6
SUMTORIAL(4) is 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 is 10

The parameter to sumtorial is stored at the symbol N
and you are to store your answer at the symbol ANS

Write your code in a file named sumtorial.asm and submit it at the end of lab.


3) If you still have time:

Write an assembly program that prints out "Hello world"
You may not use the PUTS trap for this.
You must print out every single character.

Write your code in a file named helloworld.asm and submit it at the end of lab.
